This branch includes just the files required for practice. Nothing too interesting.

Few Tips I Have Learnt
----------------------

* ```>G``` indent from current line till end of the file
* dot command also repeats the inserts (inserted blocks between ```i``` and ```<Esc>```)
* ```C``` change till the end of the line
* ```s``` substitute first character on the right with the edit
* ```S``` substitute an entire line
